# Explore the Tech! 

In today's blog, I am going to discuss a topic related to ***teams*** in the programming field and summarizing the article of: ***What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team***. So, _let's get started!_

The author of this article says that as commerce becomes increasingly global and complex, the bulk of modern work is more and more team-based, and that studies show that over the last two decades and that, at many companies, more than three-quarters of an employeeâ€™s day is spent communicating with colleagues. Then, he mentioned an example of the software engineers working in _Silicon Valley_, and how they are encouraged to work together because groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems. Studies also show that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction. 

As a conclusion, and from the stories mentioned in the article, we understand that groups sometimes can be a stress source for you, and some team members tend to critizice each other and speak louder, which creates pressure in the team. However, working with a team that has an open mindset can imrpove individuals to give better ideas and be more productive. Furthermore, employee performance optimization is not enough to improve the productivity of an individual if we do not focus on team work.

Some studies showed that teams that were friends together and socialized outside of work were the most effective.
Our data-saturated age enables us to examine our work habits and office quirks with a scrutiny that our cubicle-bound forebears could only dream of. 

Finally, the author discussed some issues facing the employees at work, he called it `re`imagining the office, and described them as follows:
1. How to Build a Perfect Team.
2. The War on Meetings.
3. The Case for Blind Hiring.
4. Failure to Lunch.
5. The 'Good Jobs' Gamble.
6. Rethinking the Work-Life Equation.
7. The Rise of White-Collar Automation.
8. The Post-Cubicle Office.
9. The New Dream Jobs.
