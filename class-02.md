In today's blog, I am goint to discuss some topics related to web development in **HTML, CSS, and Javascript**. So, _let's get started!_

### 1. Text in _HTML_:
Text in HTML is represted in various tags, which are desrcibed as follows:
* Headingds `<h1>` to `<h6>`: contains _six_ levels of headings, where `<h1>` indicates the most important heading, and `<h6>` indicates the least important headings.
* Paragraphs `<p>`: container of paragprahs of text, where each paragraph is shown on a new linewith some space between it and any subsequent paragraphs.
* Bold `<b>` and Italic `<i>`.
* Supscripts `<sup>` such as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts, and Subscripts `<sub>` used commonly with foot notes or chemical formulas.
* Line breaks `<br />` and Horizental Rules `<hr />`.
* Strong `<strong>` that indicates important content an shown as blod. While Emphasis `<em>` is shown as italic and indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence.
* Quotations: `<blockquote>` that is used for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph. And `<q>` that is used for shorter quotes that sit within a paragraph. 
* Abbreviations `<abbr>` and Acrynoms `<acrynom>`.
* Citations `<cite>` and definitions `<dfn>`.
* Author Details: `<address>`.
* Changes to content: `<ins>` used to show content that has been inserted into a document, `<del>` to show text that has been deleted from it, and `<s>` that indicates something that is no longer accurate or relevant (but that should not be deleted).


### 2. Introducting _CSS_.
