In today's blog, I am going to be discussing several topics related to web development in ***HTML, CSS, and Javascript***. So, _let's get started!_

### 1. Forms in _HTML_:
Forms are defined like this: `<form action="", method="">`, and there are several types of form controls that you can use to collect information from visitors to your site, such as follows:
* Adding text: `<input type="text">`, `<input type="password">`, `<textarea>` 
* Making Choices: `<input type="radio">`, `<input type="checkbox">`, `<select><option>`.
* Submitting forms: `<input type="submit">`.
* Uploading files: `<input type="file">`.
* Date: `<input type="date">`.
* Labeling of elements: `<label>`.
* Groubing form elements: `<fieldset><legend>`.
* E-mail: `<input type="email">`.
Search: `<input type="search">`.

Also, form work as follows:
1. A user fills in a form and then presses a button to submit the information to the server.
2. The name of each form control is sent to the server along with the value the user enters or selects.
3. The server processes the information using a programming language such as PHP, C#, VB.net, or Java. It may also store the information in a database.
4. The server creates a new page to send back to the browser based on the information received.


### 2. Lists, tables, and forms in _CSS_:
There are several CSS properties that were created to work with specific types of HTML elements, such as lists, tables, and forms, and some are discussed in the following:
* `list-style-type`: allows you to control the shape or style of a bullet point (also known as a **marker**).
* `list-style-image`: pecifies an image to act as a bullet point.
* `list-style-position`: indicates whether the marker should appear on the inside or the outside of the box containing the main points.
* `list-style`: allows you to express the markers' style, image and position properties in any order.
**Table properties**: 
* `width`: to set the width of the table.
* `padding`: to set the space between the border of each table cell and its content.
* `text-transform`: to convert the content of the table headers to uppercase.
* `letter-spacing`, `font-size`: to add additional styling to the content of the table headers.
* `border-top`, `border-bottom`: to set borders above and below the table headers
* `text-align`: to align the writing to the left of some table cells and to the right of the others.
* `background-color`: to change the background color of the alternating table rows.
* `:hover`: to highlight a table row when a user's mouse goes over it.
* `empty-cells`: to specify whether or not their borders should be shown.
* `border-spacing`: allows you to control the distance between adjacent cells.
**Forms Properties**:
* Text Input: `font-size`, `color`, `background-color`, `border`, `border-radius`, `background-image`.
* Submit Buttons: `color`, `text-shadow`, `border-bottom`, `background-color`.
* Fieldsets and Legends: `width`, `color`, `background-color`, `border`, `border-radius`, `padding`.
**Cursor**: `auto`, `crosshair`, `default`, `pointer`, `move`, `text`, `wait`, `help`, `url("cursor.gif");`
