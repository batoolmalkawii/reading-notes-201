In today's blog, I am going to be discussing several topics related to web development in ***HTML, CSS, and Javascript***. So, _let's get started!_

### 1. Forms in _HTML_:
Forms are defined like this: `<form action="", method="">`, and there are several types of form controls that you can use to collect information from visitors to your site, such as follows:
* Adding text: `<input type="text">`, `<input type="password">`, `<textarea>` 
* Making Choices: `<input type="radio">`, `<input type="checkbox">`, `<select><option>`.
* Submitting forms: `<input type="submit">`.
* Uploading files: `<input type="file">`.
* Date: `<input type="date">`.
* Labeling of elements: `<label>`.
* Groubing form elements: `<fieldset><legend>`.
* E-mail: `<input type="email">`.
Search: `<input type="search">`.

Also, form work as follows:
1. A user fills in a form and then presses a button to submit the information to the server.
2. The name of each form control is sent to the server along with the value the user enters or selects.
3. The server processes the information using a programming language such as PHP, C#, VB.net, or Java. It may also store the information in a database.
4. The server creates a new page to send back to the browser based on the information received.
