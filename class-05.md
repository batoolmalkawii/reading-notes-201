In today's blog, I am goint to discuss some topics related to web development using **HTML AND CSS**. So, _let's get started!_

### 1. Images
To add an image into the page you need to use an `<img>` element. It must carry the following two attributes: `src`, which tells the browser where it can find the image file. `alt`, whcih provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it, and `title` to provide additional information about the image. There are addintional attributes that can be added to the `<img>` tag, described as follows:
* `height` and `width`.
* `align`, which can be `left` and `right` for horizantal alginment, and `top`, `middle` and `bottom` for vertical alignment.

Images can be displayed in different places on the webpage, such as:
1. before a paragraph.
2. inside the start of a paragraph.
3. in the middle of a paragraph

The images you use on your website should be saved at the same width and height that you want them to appear on the page. Generally, there are three rules for creating images:
1. Save images in the right format.
2. Save images at the right size.
3. Use the correct resolution.

There are several image formats, such as **JPG**, **PNG**, and **GIF**, which are pixel images. Also, you can use vectorized images that are based on mathemetical representation, and if you want to crop an image, it is important not to lose valuable information. It is best to source
images that are the correct shape if possible.
