In today's blog, I am going to discuss some topics related to _Web Development_. Specifically, **HTML, CSS, AND JavaScript**. So, _Let's get started!_


### 1. Lists in _HTML_:
There are several types of lists in HTML, described as follows:
* Ordered Lists: creates a **Numbered** list. It is created using `<ol>` element, and each item is inserted between `<li>` tags.
* Unordered Lists: creates a **Bullet** list. It is created using `<ul>` element, and each item is inserted between `<li>` tags.
* Definition Lists: creates a list containing a series of **terms** and their **definitions**. It is created using `<dl>` element, and each term is inserted between `<dt>` tags while `<dd>` is for definitions. 


### 2. Boxes:
Each tag in HTML is considered a _Box_. The specifications, styles, and sizes of these boxes can be controlled by a number of _CSS_ properties, described as follows:
* Box Dimensions: `width` and `Height`.
* Limiting Width: `min-width` and `max-width`.
* Limiting Height: `min-height` and `max-height`.
* Overflow Content: `overflow` with the following options: `scroll` and `hidden`.
* Borders: `border`, `border-width`, `border-image`, `border-radius` and `border-style`
* Padding: `padding`, `padding-top`, `padding-bottom`, `padding-left` and `padding-right`.
* Margin: `margin`, `margin-top`, `margin-bottom`, `margin-left` and `margin-right`.
* Display: `display` allows you to turn an inline element into a block-level element or vice versa, and can also be used to hide an element from the page. The options for this property are: `inline`, `block`, `inline-block` and `none`.
* Hiding Boxes: `visibility`, the options are: `visible` and `hidden`.
* Box Shadow: `box-shadow` allows you to add a drop shadow around a box.
